### Hi there, I'm Sajith 👋 (He/Him 🏳️‍🌈)

I am a Senior Software Engineer from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 currently living in Berlin/Germany 🇩🇪 and working at [lemon.markets](https://www.lemon.markets/). My favorite programming language is Kotlin and IntelliJIdea is the best IDE ever.

Apart from coding I just love Butterbrezel🥨, Ice Skating ⛸, ice coffee + 🥛 with a lot of sugar and traveling ✈️ all around the world 🌏

<!--
I have no idea why you wanted to look at the raw file, anyways here is the last verse from my favorite poem

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.
